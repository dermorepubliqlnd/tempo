-- Migration 2026-07-21: project-level timeline governance
--
-- Backfills two pieces that were built live in an earlier session but never
-- appended to this file (a real gap found while writing this migration --
-- projects.timelines_locked and set_project_timelines_locked existed in
-- the live DB with no record here): both are included below via
-- idempotent add-column-if-not-exists / create-or-replace-function so
-- re-running this file is safe.
--
-- New in this migration:
--   1. projects.original_start_date / original_due_date -- a frozen
--      baseline stamped once at Lock time, mirroring tasks.original_due_date.
--   2. set_project_timelines_locked now also stamps the project's own
--      baseline at lock, and -- the real behavior change -- an owner can no
--      longer self-service unlock a committed project. Locking stays
--      self-service (a one-way commitment, low stakes); unlocking now
--      requires either Full Access, or an approved Project Extension
--      Request (via the new decide_project_extension_request, which flips
--      a bypass flag to perform the unlock internally).
--   3. A projects-table trigger (enforce_project_date_lock) enforces the
--      same "can't change without the bypass flag" rule at the DB level
--      for start_date/end_date once locked -- parity with tasks' existing
--      enforce_due_date_lock, not just an app-level gate.
--   4. tasks_due_date_lock now also fires on INSERT, not just UPDATE, so a
--      brand-new task can't be inserted (e.g. via direct API/SQL, bypassing
--      the app's own within-envelope default) with a due date beyond the
--      project's committed end_date while locked, with no extension trail
--      at all.
--   5. extension_requests.task_id is now nullable, with a new nullable
--      project_id -- exactly one of the two must be set. Project-level
--      requests ALWAYS escalate to the project owner's manager (or Full
--      Access); unlike task-level requests, there is no "owner decides"
--      path at all, since a project owner extending their own project's
--      deadline is structurally the self-request case task-level extensions
--      already force to escalate.
--   6. task_effort_changes: a lightweight, trigger-written audit log (not a
--      lock) -- effort-level corrections don't need approval the way due
--      dates do (it's an estimate, not an external commitment), but they
--      should be visible when they happen.

-- Sandra): one running timer per person globally; stopping opens an
-- immediate confirm/edit-once step, then the entry is locked; manual
-- entries (logged after the fact) always require approval via the same
-- owner-decides / self-request-escalates-to-manager rule as extension
-- requests; idle timers auto-stop after a configurable threshold (default
-- 4h) and land back in the confirm step flagged "auto-stopped"; Full
-- Access can correct an already-confirmed/approved entry, with the
-- original value preserved so the correction is never silent; Spent Hrs
-- becomes fully computed from confirmed/approved/legacy entries instead of
-- being directly typed, with existing values preserved as one frozen
-- "legacy" baseline entry per task; time tracking gets its own dedicated
-- log, separate from Extension Requests.

-- short of manually pushing the end time forward. Now: equal timestamps are
-- allowed and always credited a minimum of 1 minute, both at stop time and

-- Migration 2026-07-23: delete_tasks_and_dependents RPC
--
-- Client-side hard-delete of a task previously did separate
-- supabase.from(table).delete().in("task_id", ids) calls against
-- extension_requests, task_effort_changes, and time_entries before
-- deleting the task itself -- but none of those tables have a DELETE
-- policy defined (extension_requests only has select/update/insert;
-- task_effort_changes and time_entries only have select;
-- task_collaborators only has select), so under RLS those client-side
-- deletes were silent no-ops (0 rows affected, no error) rather than
-- actually removing the dependent rows. The subsequent `delete from
-- tasks` then still hit the foreign-key constraint on whichever
-- dependent table had a real row for that task -- first surfaced as
-- extension_requests_task_id_fkey (2026-07-22, thought fixed by just
-- adding a client-side delete call, but that call was quietly a no-op
-- all along), then task_effort_changes_task_id_fkey for Task 4
-- (2026-07-23, same root cause). Centralizing this in one
-- security-definer RPC: authorization is checked explicitly (mirrors
-- tasks_delete's own policy condition) and then all four dependent
-- tables are cleared with the function's elevated privileges,
-- bypassing RLS by design -- the same pattern already used by
-- set_project_timelines_locked / decide_project_extension_request for
-- other multi-table writes.

--
-- Sandra: the old project_status field conflated two different questions

-- "where in the production pipeline is it" (phase) -- which is why
-- Paused sat awkwardly next to Design in the same list. Design agreed
-- live: `status` is now a small fixed lifecycle set (Not Started/In
-- Progress/Completed/Paused/Cancelled); `phase` is the pipeline stage
-- (Backlog/Queued under Not Started, Planning/Design/Development/
-- Evaluation/Delivery under In Progress, Done under Completed). Paused
-- and Cancelled deliberately do NOT get their own phase value -- phase
-- simply freezes at whatever it already was when a project is paused or
-- cancelled, so you can see both that it stopped and where it stopped,
-- without inventing a phase that doesn't mean anything on its own.
-- "Merged" is retired entirely (Sandra: delete it, no replacement) --
-- existing Merged rows are treated as Completed/Done on migration since
-- it was already a done-equivalent under the old Health bucket logic.
--
-- Order matters: phase must be backfilled from the OLD project_status
-- value before that same column gets overwritten with the new Status
-- value in the next statement.

-- also wants the OTHER two modes' numbers retained for reporting, not
-- discarded once one is chosen. This table is that audit trail: every
-- Finalize click writes one row per mode per task (grouped by a shared

-- Migration 2026-07-24f: per-mode Start columns for WBS planning
--
-- Sandra caught a real design flaw live: a task's Start was one shared
-- field used by BOTH Full Effort and Conservative Effort's math. Once
-- dependencies existed, this broke down completely -- auto-moving that
-- one field to sit right after a predecessor's Full Effort end left
-- Conservative Effort (whose same predecessor finishes LATER) still
-- starting too early, with no way to fix it since there was only one
-- Start to move. Her own diagnosis: "I think the toggle on top cause the
-- issue" -- the single "active mode" toggle was being used to decide
-- which mode's math a single shared Start should follow, when Full
-- Effort and Conservative Effort actually need their OWN independent
-- Start per task.
--
-- Fix: two new nullable draft columns, one per mode, backfilled from the
-- existing `start_date` so today's values aren't lost. These are WBS
-- planning-only drafts (same idea as `current_due_date` already being
-- draft-only until Save) -- the original `start_date`/`current_due_date`
-- columns are UNTOUCHED and remain the single canonical schedule the
-- rest of the app (Projects & Tasks table, Timeline, Calendar) reads;
-- WBS's own Save button still picks one mode and writes into those two
-- original columns exactly as before, so nothing downstream changes.

-- own End live (via a sync effect) until the user directly types a Start
-- themselves, at which point that mode's flag flips to false and the value

-- Sandra: when a task or project is permanently deleted, its historical
-- Utilization/Day-Planner points and Spent Hrs should NOT disappear
-- retroactively. "Just the numbers" scope (her explicit choice): no
-- task/project name retained, just the raw per-day points/hours per
-- person, and per-project logged-hours totals. Archived BEFORE the
-- delete happens, inside the same RPCs that already perform task/project
-- deletion, so there's no separate path that could delete without
-- archiving.
