// Phase just freezes at whatever it already was when a project stops, so

// REVIVED 2026-09-10: Cancelled is back as its own 4th group, distinct from
// "Complete"/Done -- deleting a task (the app's other non-Done-but-stopped
// option) destroys logged-hours history and breaks dependency references,
// which turned out to be a real cost once teams started actually cancelling
// scoped-but-abandoned work. Cancelled is a genuine dead-end, not a
// completion, so it gets its own bucket rather than being folded into
// Complete -- statusGroupOf below returns a distinct "cancelled" tag so
// every caller that branches on "complete" (Timing, Days +/-, the
// scheduler's isOpenTask, etc.) can tell the two apart instead of treating
// a cancelled task as if it had actually finished.
