// request is what actually flips it), so every RPC/RLS policy/guardrail
// keyed off the literal "draft" string keeps working unchanged. This is
// the one place that swaps in a friendlier label + its own tone (reusing
// the warning/amber hue, same as Revision in Progress) wherever the
// badge is shown, whenever a project both IS draft and has a pending
// request -- callers pass that one boolean in, they don't need to know
// anything about baseline requests themselves.

// returned for review"): same display-only overlay pattern as the

// 'draft' in the DB, no new enum value. `declineReason` is only used to
// build the hint text (kept optional so any older/degenerate call site
// without it still gets a sensible generic hint rather than a crash).
