// idea from taskScheduling.ts's `capacityBasedScenario`, but that function
// only returns a single task's final due date/wholeDays -- it doesn't give
// us the full per-day, per-task, per-project breakdown a whole-team grid
// needs to render every cell. Rather than modify that live, shared module,
// this is a fresh implementation of the same forward-walk idea with the
// extra bookkeeping the grid needs. Do not import taskScheduling.ts here;
// keep this module self-contained.

// Unifies what used to be two separate PM-overhead mechanisms (Day
// Planner's manual-entry default of 0.5h/day, and Utilization's old
// points-based 0.1pt/day ~= 0.75h-equivalent with a combined 0.3pt/day ~=
// 2.25h cap across all owned projects). Phase 2 replaces both with one
// flat allowance: every project a person owns gets this many hours/day of
// PM overhead on its own working days, with NO combined cross-project cap
// -- if you own three active projects, that is 3 * rate = however many
// hours/day of PM time, uncapped. Intentional per Sandra's Phase 2 sign-off.
// Lowered 0.5 -> 0.25 (2026-08-24, Sandra): 30 min/day/project was an
// uncalibrated placeholder feeding directly into the Actual view, which
// exists specifically to expose true overallocation -- an overstated
// PM assumption was manufacturing overload that was not real work. Still
// uncapped per Sandra's call to revisit a combined cap only if a
// multi-project owner still looks overloaded from overhead alone.
// Lives in dailyAllocation.ts now (one constant for the grid, the scheduler
// AND the SQL deletion archive, which used to carry its own stale 0.5).
// Re-exported here so existing importers keep working unchanged.
