// Self-service Project Category icons/colors (Phase 36, 2026-09-03).
//
// Category names themselves are admin-editable (project_categories table,
// managed in Site Settings). Each category also carries an `icon` (a key
// into CATEGORY_ICON_LIBRARY below) and a `color` (a key into
// CATEGORY_TONE_COLOR / one of the app's existing status-pill tones) --
// both stored as plain text columns on project_categories and picked by
// Sandra from the fixed palettes below, rather than hardcoded per name in
// Projects.tsx like before. A category row with an icon name not present
// in this library (or none set) falls back to Folder/neutral -- this can
// only happen if the DB value drifts from what the picker offers, since
// the picker only ever writes a name from this exact list.
//
// Keeping this list here (rather than duplicated in Projects.tsx and
// SiteSettings.tsx) is what lets the "Manage Project Categories" picker
// grid and the actual rendered badges everywhere else (Projects table,
// Board, Timeline, Dashboard) always stay in sync automatically.
